1. What is Scrypto?

Scrypto is a secure substition cipher built on the Crypto 1.4.9 source.
Scrypto removed the option of a default key from Crypto and allows users to customize 
the offset value of the substition. This is makes the encryption slightly more 
difficult to crack. (Though still not recommended for sensitive data.)
