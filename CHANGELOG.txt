This change log only shows changes from the Crypto 1.4.9 source and later.
A full version from Crypto Alpha 0.0.1 to Release 1.4.9
can be found in the Crypto package.


Scrypto is a substition cipher program based on Crypto.


Release 1.5:
* All of these new changes have caused issues with Python 3,
so I've focussed development on Python 2.7
(once I've finished core code, I will work on functionality.)
Scrypto:
* Created a branch of Crypto called Scrypto for more secure
and personalized encoding.
* Removed 35 or so unnecessary lines. 
* Began preperation for removal of default key mode
* Removed the default key mode
* Changed the way custom keys are created so that they do not always substitute by 9.
* Program now asks for a cipher offset on Create Key.
* Program disguises the key in Depend.txt
(Will try to creatively cover up for the offset as well.
I'm thinking something from the random module might do the trick.)
* Made encode and decode tell the user to create a key before launching.
(Might have them launch Create New Key at a future date.)
* Added randrange to ensure that data stored 
with the key is never created the same way twice.
